2. Even Fibonacci numbers
=========================

`From Project Euler <https://projecteuler.net/problem=2>`__

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

.. code-block:: python

    def fib():
        yield 1
        last, this = 1, 2
        while this < 4000000:  # less than 4mil
            yield this
            new_last, new_this = this, last + this
            last, this = new_last, new_this

    sum_even_fib = 0
    for i in fib():
        if i % 2 == 0:
          sum_even_fib += i
    
    >>> print(sum_even_fib)
    4613732
