Maxwell G. Brown's Notebook
===========================

This is a notebook kept by Maxwell G Brown to keep track of any neat tricks or abbreviated notes on programming.


----------------
Python Libraries
----------------

These are examples of how to work with these specific python libraries, whether they be system packages or 3rd party.

Within the main page for the package there may be examples saved as sub-pages. 

Many examples will have functional code examples in ``docs/source/python_libraries/examples/``

.. toctree::
   :name: python_libraries
   :maxdepth: 1 
   :glob:

   python_libraries/argparse
   python_libraries/fabric
   python_libraries/imaplib
   python_libraries/mailthon
   python_libraries/mako
   python_libraries/unittest
   python_libraries/paramiko
   python_libraries/pymongo
   python_libraries/pyramid
   python_libraries/wtforms


--------------------
Python Code Snippets
--------------------

These are code snippets (usually a function or class) that are small in scope used to solve a certain problem.

Most/all solutions here are cut & paste solutions.

.. toctree::
   :name: python_snippets
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:

   python_snippets/dictionary_combinations


--------------------
Programming Patterns
--------------------

These are programming patterns that can be applied to future development.

Examples aren't necessarily functional examples, but more of a demonstration of how they're used.
