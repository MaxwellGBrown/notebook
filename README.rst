MaxwellGBrown's Programming Notebook
====================================

Hello!

This is my personal public notebook. I maintain my code-snippets, brain dumps,
examples, explanations with it's "pages".

This notebook *requires* ``sphinx``. Make sure it's installed in whatever
environment you're using.

::

  $ pip install sphinx


To build the docs, install the package using ``setup.py``. I prefer to use it
as a development-egg.

:: 

  $ python setup.py develop


After that, use the packaged ``notebook`` script to build & open them in your
local browser!

::

  $ notebook
